05_DOCUMENTATION

Purpose

- Centralize operational/guidance docs for the GPT package: quick start, policies, maintenance, security, test plan, changelog.

Canonical sources to pull from

- docs/gpt/ (PANELIN_GPT_BUILDER_QUICK_FILL, SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS_CANONICAL reference, CAPABILITIES_POLICY, SECURITY_POLICY, TEST_PLAN, MAINTENANCE, CHANGELOG).
- Panelin_GPT/05_DOCUMENTATION/ (QUICK_START, SECURITY_POLICY, MAINTENANCE, CAPABILITIES_POLICY).
- panelin_reports/ (PDF generation docs) if needed for this package.

Populate

- Keep one Quick Start, one Security Policy, one Maintenance guide, one Capabilities/Policy doc, one Test Plan, and one Changelog.
- Prefer linking out to wiki/agent docs for deep system/architecture details instead of duplicating.
- If duplicates exist, place non-canonical versions in 05_DOCUMENTATION/ARCHIVE/ and note which file is authoritative.
