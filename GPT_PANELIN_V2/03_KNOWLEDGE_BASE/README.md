03_KNOWLEDGE_BASE

Purpose

- Consolidated KB artifacts for the GPT: JSON files, ledger, and manifest.

Canonical sources to pull from

- Panelin_GPT/03_KNOWLEDGE_BASE/ (panelin_truth_bmcuruguay.json, product_catalog.json, LEDGER_CHECKPOINT.md).
- Any additional KB JSONs referenced in docs/gpt/PANELIN_KNOWLEDGE_MANIFEST.md.

Populate

- Place the final KB JSON files and LEDGER here.
- Maintain a single KB manifest (KB_MANIFEST.md) in this folder to track file names, purpose, and freshness.
- If uncertain about legacy KB files, place them in 03_KNOWLEDGE_BASE/ARCHIVE/ and note status in KB_MANIFEST.md.
