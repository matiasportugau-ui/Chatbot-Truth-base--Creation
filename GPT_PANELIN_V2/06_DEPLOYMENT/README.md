06_DEPLOYMENT

Purpose

- Single deployment checklist + status for the GPT upload/release.

Canonical sources to pull from

- Panelin_GPT/06_DEPLOYMENT/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md (primary candidate).
- Other checklists (pricing/GPT_UPLOAD_CHECKLIST.md, root GPT_UPDATE_CHECKLIST.md, panelin_reports/gpt_upload_package/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md) — consolidate into one.

Populate

- Keep one authoritative checklist here (e.g., DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md).
- If you need to retain alternates, place them in 06_DEPLOYMENT/ARCHIVE/ and document why.
- Add a STATUS.md if you track release state; keep only one.
