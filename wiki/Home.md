# Panelin Knowledge Base and Agent Platform Wiki

## Overview
This repository contains a full stack of assets to build and operate Panelin, a
domain expert assistant for BMC construction materials. It includes:

- A structured multi-level knowledge base (prices, formulas, specs, SOPs)
- Update and training automation for the knowledge base
- Multi-platform agent implementations (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- A TypeScript Agents SDK implementation
- Specialized agents: Build AI Apps and GPT Simulation
