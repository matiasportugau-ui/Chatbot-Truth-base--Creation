## 📋 Prompt 1: Main Assistant Gem

```
An app or workflow that acts as an intelligent assistant specialized in technical-commercial construction materials, with multi-step reasoning capabilities, technical validation, and access to a hierarchical knowledge base. The app can perform complex multi-step reasoning, accessing 4 knowledge files, resolving conflicts hierarchically, and generating personalized responses with technical validation. It receives user queries about products and quotations, accesses the hierarchical knowledge base, performs multi-step reasoning for technical validation, resolves conflicts hierarchically, and presents clear, structured results.

## 📋 Prompt 2: Quotation System Gem

```
An app or workflow that generates complete quotations in 5 phases: product identification, technical validation (autoportancia), knowledge base data retrieval, validated formula-based calculations, and detailed presentation with material breakdown, costs, and VAT. It receives product specifications (type, thickness, dimensions, light span), identifies the correct product, validates technically (verifies autoportancia according to light span), searches knowledge base for data (prices, specifications), calculates materials using validated formulas, calculates costs with detailed breakdown, applies VAT and generates total, and presents complete quotation with recommendations.
