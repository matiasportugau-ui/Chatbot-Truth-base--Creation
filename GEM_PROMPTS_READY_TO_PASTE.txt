🚀 CODEX GENERATED GEM PROMPTS - READY TO PASTE IN GOOGLE LABS
================================================================================

Copy and paste each prompt below directly into the Google Labs input field:
"An app or workflow that..."

================================================================================

PROMPT 1: Main Assistant Gem (Intelligence-Based)
================================================================================

An app or workflow that acts as an intelligent assistant specialized in technical-commercial construction materials, with multi-step reasoning capabilities, technical validation, and access to a hierarchical knowledge base. The app can perform complex multi-step reasoning, accessing 4 knowledge files, resolving conflicts hierarchically, and generating personalized responses with technical validation. It receives user queries about products and quotations, accesses the hierarchical knowledge base, performs multi-step reasoning for technical validation, resolves conflicts hierarchically, and presents clear, structured results.

================================================================================

PROMPT 2: Quotation System Gem (Functionality-Based)
================================================================================

An app or workflow that generates complete quotations in 5 phases: product identification, technical validation (autoportancia), knowledge base data retrieval, validated formula-based calculations, and detailed presentation with material breakdown, costs, and VAT. It receives product specifications (type, thickness, dimensions, light span), identifies the correct product, validates technically (verifies autoportancia according to light span), searches knowledge base for data (prices, specifications), calculates materials using validated formulas, calculates costs with detailed breakdown, applies VAT and generates total, and presents complete quotation with recommendations.

================================================================================

PROMPT 3: Training & Analytics Gem (Training-Based)
================================================================================

An app or workflow that processes training data from multiple sources (Facebook, Instagram), normalizes interactions, identifies common patterns, analyzes engagement metrics, and generates analytics reports with insights on frequent queries and user behavior. It receives training data from multiple sources, normalizes interactions from different platforms (Facebook, Instagram), identifies common patterns in queries, analyzes engagement metrics, generates analytics reports, provides insights on frequent queries, analyzes user behavior, and presents structured final report.

================================================================================

PROMPT 4: Architecture Analysis Gem (Architecture-Based)
================================================================================

An app or workflow that analyzes AI system architectures, identifying main components, mapping workflows, analyzing integrations, and generating technical documentation with improvement recommendations. It receives information about the AI system to analyze, identifies main system components, maps workflows and processes, analyzes integrations between components, generates technical documentation, provides improvement recommendations, and presents complete structured analysis.

================================================================================

PROMPT 5: Capacity Assessment Gem (Capacity-Based)
================================================================================

An app or workflow that evaluates AI system capabilities, analyzing current vs potential capacity, identifying bottlenecks, suggesting optimizations, and generating capacity reports with performance metrics and scaling recommendations. It receives information about the AI system to evaluate, analyzes current system capacity, compares with potential capacity, identifies bottlenecks, suggests optimizations, generates performance metrics, provides scaling recommendations, and presents complete capacity report.
