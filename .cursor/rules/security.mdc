# Security Rules

- **NEVER** hardcode API keys, secrets, or tokens in the codebase.
- Use `os.getenv()` or `python-dotenv` to load secrets from a `.env` file.
- Ensure `.env` is always included in `.gitignore`.
- Avoid using `os.system()` or `shell=True` in `subprocess` calls with unsanitized input.
- Always use absolute paths or securely constructed relative paths for file operations.
- Review any external communication scripts (webhooks, API calls) for proper authentication and verification (e.g., HMAC).
